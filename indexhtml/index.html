				THE MAGIC OF GLOWING CREATURES
			</h2>
			<p id="didText">
				Did you know some animals and plants can glow
				in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence.
				It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their
				bodies creates light. It's like nature's version of neon lights!
			</p>
			<h3 id="hereHeader">Here's how it works:</h3>
			<ol id="workList">
				<li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
				<li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
				<li>Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat - it's called “cold light.”</li>
			</ol>
